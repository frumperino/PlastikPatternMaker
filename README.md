# PlastikPatternMaker
LED pattern maker for Plastikophobia exhibit at Sustainable Singapore Gallery 2019

Made with Processing

The .jar file is the java-based executable. Works on Mac, Windows or Unix. 

Pre-requisites:
OpenGL support on your computer. 
JRE installed. Download from Oracle.com
ffmpeg installed (if you want to export video clips from the app.)

With PlastikPatternMaker you can create patterns that can be shown on the LEDs of the installation.
The created pattern definitions are in the form of PNG files with horizontal columns representing time frames at 120Hz, and the vertical axis representing pixel control channels, of which there are four groups.
